# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
This project is the analysis of an ecommerce website. It helps us to understand various parameters leading to sales for the organization.

## Process
1. Load Data Into Psql Tool by creation of tables. Did it by writing create table query commmand.
2. Cleaned the data:

   - Removed Irrelevant data columns (Alter Commands)
   - Removed duplicates from database   (Used SELF JOINS and DELETE Command)
   - Removed and Filled Null Values where needed    (Using WHERE and DELETE FROM)
   - Did conversions of columns like date, time etc.   (type Cast like to_date etc)

## Results
- The data and my analysis highlights many points wherein we can say that the organization focus more on lost cost products in terms of price and stationary,  electronics and apparels for Product Categories.
- The products should be pushed more in smaller nations like Thailand, Ukraine etc. This is reflected in my answer of 5th question o assignment.

## Challenges
- Cleaning the data was the most time consuming task. Understanding the data to delete irrelevant columns and data was tough. 
- Making descision to delete null values was also a hard call. Every NULL value replacement needed thought behind it.
- Creating Joins and segragating data to do further analysis took time. Maing self joins to clean the data specially duplicate rows were really time consuming. 

## Future Goals
- I am able to do the task confidently. However with more time I would
have cleaned the data in more efficient way.
- I would have analysed more questions especially the data from products table. The values of sentiment and consumer would have been a great help to find the right story behind the companies sales.
